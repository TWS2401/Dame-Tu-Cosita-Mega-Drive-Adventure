"Dame Tu Cosita: Mega Drive Adventure" is a work-in-progress hack of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Mega Drive. It follows the adventures of Popoy the Alien from the "Dame Tu Cosita" music video through levels based off of memes within (what was at the time) recent years. It includes original level layouts and palette changes (for now). The hack includes 6 different zones:

Mars Zone - Popoy's home planet, now invaded by countless of robots. Who could be behind this...?
Walmart Zone - Popoy rides a rocket bot to Earth, one of the planets known to house some of the cruelest creatures to demand answers. He lands and finds a large building with the word "Walmart" on it. As Popoy travels through, he finds more bots terrorising the eerily empty place. This is even more confusing...
Suicide Forest Zone - Popoy tries to take off back to his home planet, but the rocket bot malfunctions and Popoy ends up in a strange forest. Hang on, I think I see a dead body over there...
Trending Page Zone - Popoy finds his way out of the forest and finds a broken computer. Suddenly, he is sucked in and is surrounded by white everywhere. And... pictures? What is "the algorithm"? Popoy makes his way through the strange area...
Fortnite Zone - Popoy leaves Youtube and ends up in another program; a video game named "Fortnite".
Mr Kyle Zone - Popoy escapes the computer and chases down the culprit for the robot infestations into a studio for a TV show named "Mr Kyle" for the final confrontation.
